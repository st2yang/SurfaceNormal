# VOC 2007/2012 detection
I used Fast RCNN for evaluating the learned features.

I followed the practice here: http://graphics.cs.cmu.edu/projects/deepContext/

## some notes
- Try to train longer to see whether you can get extra boost.
- make sure you are using the same input normalization
- use the group-less proto-text
